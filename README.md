## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
### For this project, I was interestested in using Boston AirBNB Data to better understand:

1.Can we predict the price of a listing in Boston AirBnB
2.How predict price value by Random Forest Regressor?
3.How predict price value by Linear Regressor ?
4.What Features are affecting the price most?
5.What is the highest proportion in each cancellation_policy category ?
6.What is the highest proportion in each review_scores_rating category ?

The full set of files related to this course are owned by Udacity, so they are not publicly available here. However, you can see pieces of the analysis here. This README also serves as a template for students to follow in creating their own project README files.

## File Descriptions
There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

There is an additional .py file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict price.

## Results
1. We gathered the listing  of the guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way.  which showed that the masses the listing activity of homestays in Boston, MA.
2. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Boston? By how much do prices spike?
3. What are the review_scores_rating category to visit Boston? By how much do prices spike?
4. Is there highest proportion in each cancellation_policy category?
